## ex00: BraiiiiiiinnnzzzZ

topic: what case it's better to allocate the zombies on the stack or heap?!?

## ex01: Moar brainz!

topic: allocate N Zombie objects in a single allocation.

## ex02: HI THIS IS BRAIN

topic: this is another syntax for something you already do: address anipulation.

## ex03: Unnecessary violence

topic: In which case do you think it would be best to use a pointer to Weapon? And a reference to Weapon?

## ex04: Sed is for losers

topic: iostream and string class! yeah, sed is for losers

## ex05: Harl 2.0

topic: use pointers to member functions. This is not a suggestion. Harl has to complain without using a **forest** of if/else if/else

## ex06: Harl filter

topic: Although there are several ways to deal with Harl, one of the most effective is to SWITCH it off.
